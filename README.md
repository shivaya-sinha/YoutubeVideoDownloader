# YoutubeVideoDownloader
Downloads Youtube Videos.

This is pretty simple and straightforward.

Just copy the link of the youtube video/playlist URL and just run the script.

The script will automatically start downloading the video with the URL you just copied.

You'll have options to pick the best/worst quality. Otherwise a list of options will be displayed so that you can

pick which resolution you wish to download.
